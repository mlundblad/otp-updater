Installation
------------

This guide will assume you have created a directory /etc/otp-updater
Copy and modify the otp-updater.conf.sample and feeds.txt.sample to this
directory (without the .sample extension).
Make modifications to the OpenTripPlanner launcher command in the configuration
file and if you have set up OpenTripPlanner using a different base directory
than the default (/var/otp) also change this.
Use the existing sample feed list (containing GTFS feeds for Portland (Oregon, USA)
and Boston (USA) or edit and add the ones you want to test with.

When set up, just running ./otp-updater.py should be sufficent to download the GTFS feeds
and generate the graphs in OpenTripPlanner.

Alternatively, one could specify the options using command line options
run ./otp-updater.py --help to see a list of options.
